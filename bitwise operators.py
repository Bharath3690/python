#these are used to compare binary numbers 

#& --->AND-->if both are 1, it sets each bit to 1

#!-->or--> if one of the two bits is 1,it sets each bit to 1

#^-->XOR-->if only one of two bits is 1,its sets each bit to 1

#-->NOT-->inverts all bits -->complement operators--its returns ones complement

# << => Zero fill left shift => the binary number is appended with 0's at the end

# >> => Right SHift => In simple terms, the right side of the bits are removed
